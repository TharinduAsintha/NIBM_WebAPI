## Introduction

When considering all the Srilankan people both youngsters and
middle age people are highly concerned about the body and
the food they take in the day to day life and going for a gym has
become a part of their lifestyle. Accordingly having
supplements have become a major part of their lifestyle.

Some people are having supplements because they need extra
nutrients for their day to day meal. By considering all above
facts we decided to build a website to raise this requirement for
the people in Sri Lanka. So that they can fulfill the supplements
needs.
